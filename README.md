# Using Pandas, obtain the following information:

The name of the student with the highest grade, and in which subject it has been achieved.
How many students have failed subjects in the first semester.
The average age of students attending the Python course.
Form a word with the initials of the names of the students sorted by age.
Write a function 'find_not_common' to find the elements not common to two Pandas Series.

Using Pandas and Seaborn/Matplotlib, represent graphically:

The average grades of all students by subject, grouped by sex.
The bivariate density of student age vs. grades, grouped by sex (showing scatter data in the central area and density curves on the axes).
